# Transformer Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Transformer model using PyTorch. The model includes the Encoder and Decoder layers, self-attention mechanisms, and position embeddings, suitable for tasks like sequence-to-sequence modeling, text generation, and more.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main script to run the Transformer model.
- `Transformer.py`: The main Transformer model class.
- `Encoder.py`: The implementation of the Transformer Encoder.
- `Decoder.py`: The implementation of the Transformer Decoder.
- `SelfAttention.py`: Implements the self-attention mechanism.
- `TransformerBlock.py`: Implements a single Transformer block.
- `example.py`: A sample script to demonstrate how to use the Transformer model with sample input data.
